# Starting up for DEV

* In IntelliJ, start Angular2rescueApplication to initiate backend
* Angular dev server - C:\dev\angular2rescue\frontend\src\main\frontend>npm start
* http://localhost:4200/

# Next thing to do

* Routing (still to look at properly) - https://angular.io/guide/router
* Play with implementing some sort of message handling in back end.
* Securing pages / Login system
* Spring boot backend API for pulling data from a DB
* Try implementing a sub module of rescue unit


## To create a new component

* Create a folder where you want the component
* Note this doesn't work in IntelliJ
* Navigate to component directory, then ng generate component componentname --skip-import

## Debugging

If something stops working after a change, check the browser console log
